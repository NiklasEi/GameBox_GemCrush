v 1.2.2:

- changes in the structure of the top list apply after gc reload now
- improved matching algorithm
--- fixed wrong matching of different gem in between 2 triplets of the same gem
- fixed that sometimes the runnable of a game continued running after the inventory was closed. This did not cause any problems apart from unnecessary load.

- implemented bombs
-   they will spawn glowing and explode later
-   added section in config: 'game.bombs' for customisation of bombs
